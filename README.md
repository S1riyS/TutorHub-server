## üìù About The Project

[**TutorHub**](https://github.com/S1riyS/TutorHub-server) - is a platform where students and teachers can find each
other. Here you can assign lessons, conveniently give and accomplish homework.

Platform has a lot of search parameters:

* Topic that you would like to learn
* Price of the lesson
* Teaching format *(e.g. remotely or teacher will go to your house)*
* Experience of tutor

Also, you can specify the time, when you are ready to study, so we can offer you those tutors, who are ready to work at
this time
